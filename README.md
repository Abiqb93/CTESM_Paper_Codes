- `chunk_2.py`: Feature extraction pipeline
- `chunk_3.py`: Model architecture definition
- `chunk_4.py`: Training loop and callbacks
- `chunk_5.py`: Evaluation and metrics
- `chunk_6.py`: Visualization and result saving

> **Note**: All inline comments and Markdown explanations have been removed for clean integration.
